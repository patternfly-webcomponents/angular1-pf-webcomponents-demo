### Details

This is a base AngularJS application developed to create examples and samples of Angular-Patternfly components. See https://github.com/patternfly/angular-patternfly

There is also a dependency on [Angular-Patternfly-Shims](https://github.com/patternfly-webcomponents/angular-patternfly-shims), component shims used to interact with Angular from WCs.
